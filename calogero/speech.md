    The parts in **bold** are not present in the slides

But if a nano-sensor can be applied outside, why not doing the same inside?

# Slide 17
Body Area Networks **are able to** measure all kinds of body parameters **but as the name says:** from the outside. **They are able to do what physicians do with their regular tools**

Many more parameters are available inside the body, such as, for instance, blood and liver characteristics. **Today, these values are examined in the lab, taking blood samples from the patient.**

The vision of In-Body Networks is that nanomachines will patrol in the body, take measurements wherever necessary, and send collected data to the outside. **Even better, if we consider actuators connected to the sensors, it will be possible that these machines immediately work on problems they detect within the body, such as cancer cells, arteriosclerosis, or HIV viruses.**

**Think, for instance, of an implanted drug pump, which could be instructed to dispense parts of its content when the IoNT considers it necessary, or of a heart pace maker which could be regulated in its frequency.**

# Slide 18
**Body Area Networks have been deeply investigated and have become reality already. In-Body Networks, however, are still mostly a vision. There are quite a few ideas of how they could become reality, but it is still a long way to go.**

**A possible architecture there would consist of** One Body Area Network wirelessly connecting all (micro) devices which are located outside the body

Within the body, there will be a number of nano device networks all operating in a certain area and specialized on certain functionalities and jobs

**Furthermore,** There will be a more powerful device which is able to analyze data from both network types and send commands to actuators also in both network types. **It does not matter if this device is part of the Body Area Network or rather connected through some other kind of wireless radio technology.**

The networks will be interconnected through a gateway

# Slide 19
**However, there are risks. Just to mention one: as soon as an In-Body Network can be controlled from the outside, there is always a risk that this will be done by non-authorized entities-be it people or be it machines.**

The integration of Body Area Networks systems within body devices and nanomachines also creates a completely new level of security related challenges.

**IoNT systems establish a direct target for a variety of potential attacks. Such** Attacks **may include**:
- theft of private data **e.g., physiological data collected by either in-body**
- disruption of medical applications **e.g., dedicated drug delivery applications controlled and coordinated by wearable computer**;
- targeted modification of communication links on the nano communication level or at the gateway

**In order to achieve a certain level of security, IoNT systems need to rely on a broad mixture of** Security solutions:
- Cryptographic primitives **In the scope of Body Area Networks, we can rely on classical cryptographic solutions such as using the symmetric AES or the asymmetric RSA algorithms. For In-Body Nano Communication, however, we need more lightweight solutions such as the biochemical cryptography**
- Key management **The gateway will have to part of a (possibly larger) PKI system. Also, the type of keys used will strongly depend on the employed communication techniques.**
- Authentication and access control **All messages to be forwarded by the gateway to the In-Body Nano Communication system of course need to be authenticated in order to prevent misuse.**
- Performance **For sensor and body area networks, it has been shown that even rather fast cryptographic algorithms become limiting factors**

# Slide 20
Plant pathogens massively affect crop productivity and are one of the significant challenges in attaining sustainable development goals related to agriculture. **The most conventional technique used for plant pathogen and resulting symptoms and disease diagnosis is their visual identification necessitating a practiced plant grower or pathologist. However, it is ineffective in detecting pathogens’ presence in the early infection phases when plant infections show no outward signs. There also are three distinct molecular tests that have been used, but all of them are costly, time-consuming, and labour-intensive, hindering the early stage, cost-effective and rapid pathogen diagnosis necessary for diversified crops.**

**On the other hand** Biosensors generates an electrical signal by integrating a biological sensing element and physicochemical transducer when coming into contact with a target analyte or pathogen.​ **As a result, a transducer takes a biomolecular interaction and turns it into a digital signal. An antibody, D.N.A., enzyme, tissue type, complete cell, etc., may all perform the function of a bioreceptor. The bioreceptor’s specialized biochemical interaction gives the biosensor its recognition specificity.**

# Slide 21
**Since farmers have started using new techniques that have enhanced crop yields, farming has become more accessible thanks to technological advances.**

Plants "classificated" by stress level can be easily taken by using IoNT-integrated biosensors with the assistance of AI, drones, 5G communication, and machine algorithms.

These concerns will aid in the development of superior nanosensor products and their eventual incorporation into the agricultural ecosystem.

**For example, Nasys, an Italian startup, developed a nanosensor based on metal oxides to measure air pollution.**

# Slide 22
Recent advancements in nano- and micro technologies have allowed the creation of plant-based biosensors that are extremely sensitive, fast, and selective.
- Nanomaterials may be toxic: Toxicity can be reduced by functionalizing nanomaterials with biocompatible materials like P.E.G
- Generation of e-waste: Green synthesis can be used in the fabrication of nanomaterials
- Low detection time: Use of the A.I. technique

**Technology mobilization will also benefit from the development of multi-entity detectable, broad-spectrum nanosensors. Some have speculated that in the not-too-distant future, we may be able to create super "new nanomaterials" that will vastly increase the performance of biosensors.**
